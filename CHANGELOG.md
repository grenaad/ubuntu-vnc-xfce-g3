### Release 23.08.1

Main changes:

- hook scripts `env.rc`, `push` and `post_push` have been updated
- handling of multiple deployment tags per image has been improved and it covers also publishing into the builder repository now
  - also less image pollution by publishing
- file `readme-local-building-example.md` got a new section `Tips and examples`, containing
  - `How to deploy all images into one repository`
- fix in `ci-builder.sh` help mode
- readme files updated
- container screenshots replaced by animations

### Release 23.08

This release brings updated and significantly shortened README files, because most of the content has been moved into the new [User guide][this-user-guide].

### Release 23.07.1

This release brings some enhancements in the Dockerfiles and the script `user_generator.rc` with the aim to better support extending the images.

### Release 23.07

This release introduces a new feature `FEATURES_OVERRIDING_ENVV`, which controls the overriding or adding of environment variables at the container startup-time.
Meaning, after the container has already been created.

The feature is enabled by default.
It can be disabled by setting the variable `FEATURES_OVERRIDING_ENVV` to zero when the container is created or the image is built.
Be aware that any other value than zero, even if unset or empty, enables the feature.

If `FEATURES_OVERRIDING_ENVV=1`, then the container startup script will look for the file `$HOME/.override/.override_envv.rc` and source all the lines that begin with the string 'export ' at the first position and contain the '=' character.

The overriding file can be provided from outside the container using *bind mounts* or *volumes*.

The lines that have been actually sourced can be reported into the container's log if the startup parameter `--verbose` or `--debug` is provided.

This feature is an enhanced implementation of the previously available functionality known as **Overriding VNC/noVNC parameters at the container startup-time**.

Therefore this is a **breaking change** for the users that already use the VNC/noVNC overriding.
They need to move the content from the previous file `$HOME"/.vnc_override.rc` into the new file `$HOME/.override/.override_envv.rc`.

### Release 23.03.2

This release mitigates the problems with the edge use case, when users bind the whole `$HOME` directory to an external folder on the host computer.

Please note that I recommend to avoid doing that. If you really want to, then your best bet is using the Docker volumes. That is the only option I've found, which works across the environments. In the discussion thread [#39](https://github.com/accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3/discussions/39) I've described the way, how to initialize a bound `$HOME` folder, if you really want to give it a try.

Main changes:

- file `.initial_sudo_password` has been moved from the `$HOME` to the `$STARTUPDIR` folder
- file `.initial_sudo_password` is not deleted, but cleared after the container user is created
- startup scripts have been adjusted and improved
- readme files have been updated

### Release 23.03.1

This is a maintenance release aiming to improve the scripts and documentation.

### Release 23.03

- updated with `TigerVNC 1.13.1` bugfix release
- also some updates in readme files

### Release 23.02.1

Features `NOVNC` and `FIREFOX_PLUS`, that are enabled by default, can be disabled via environment variables:

- If `FEATURES_NOVNC="0"`, then
  - image will not include `noVNC`
  - image tag will get the `-vnc` suffix (e.g. `latest-vnc`, `20.04-firefox-vnc` etc.)
- If `FEATURES_FIREFOX_PLUS="0"` and `FEATURES_FIREFOX="1"`, then
  - image with Firefox will not include the *Firefox Plus features*
  - image tag will get the `-default` suffix (e.g. `latest-firefox-default` or also `latest-firefox-default-vnc` etc.)

### Release 23.02

This is the first `G3v4` release, introducing the updated startup scripts.  The previous version `G3v3` will still be available in this repository as the branch `archived-generation-g3v3`.

- The updated startup scripts that support overriding the user ID (`id`) and group ID (`gid`) without needing the former build argument `ARG_FEATURES_USER_GROUP_OVERRIDE`, which has been removed.
- The user ID and the group ID can be overridden during the build time (`docker build`) and the run time (`docker run`).
- The `user name`, the `group name` and the `initial sudo password` can be overridden during the build time.
- The permissions of the files `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/groups` are set to the standard `644` after creating the user.
- The content of the home folder and the startup folder belongs to the created user.
- The created user gets permissions to use `sudo`. The initial `sudo` password is configurable during the build time using the build argument `ARG_SUDO_INITIAL_PW`. The password can be changed inside the container.
- The default `id:gid` has been changed from `1001:0` to `1000:1000`.

Changes in build arguments:

- removed `ARG_FEATURES_USER_GROUP_OVERRIDE` and `ARG_HOME_OWNER`
- renamed `ARG_SUDO_PW` to `ARG_SUDO_INITIAL_PW`
- added `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_ID`, `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_NAME`, `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_ID` and `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_NAME`

Changes in environment variables:

- removed `FEATURES_USER_GROUP_OVERRIDE`
- added `HEADLESS_USER_ID`, `HEADLESS_USER_NAME`, `HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_ID` and `HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_NAME`

Main changes in files:

- updated `Dockerfile.xfce.22-04` and `Dockerfile.xfce.20-04`
- updated `startup.sh`, `user_generator.rc` and `set_user_permissions.sh`
- updated hook scripts `env.rc`, `build`, `pre_build` and `util.rc`
- updated `ci-builder.sh`
- added `tests/test-01.sh` allows to quickly check the current permissions

Updated versions:

- **TigerVNC** to version `1.13.0`
- **noVNC** to version `1.4.0`

### Release 23.01

This is the first `G3v3` release, introducing the images based on `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`. The previous version `G3v2` will still be available in this repository as the branch `archived-generation-g3v2`.

Changes in deployment:

- default base of the `latest` images is now `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`
  - there is no `snap` included
  - `Firefox` is the latest non-snap version from the Mozilla Team PPA
  - `Chromium` is the latest version from the `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS` distribution
  - `latest` images will be doubled by the tags with the prefix `22.04`
- images based on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` will still be published
  - their tags will begin with the prefix `20.04`
- image `accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3:latest-fugo` will not be published any more (it can still be built manually)
- image `accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3:latest-plus`, containing the **Firefox Plus Features**, becomes the `latest` image now
  - previous `latest` image without the **Firefox Plus Features** will not be published any more (it can still be built manually)

Support of additional building parameters:

- script `builder.sh` passes the additional building parameters, that come after the mandatory ones, to the hook scripts
- script `hooks/build` can use the `--target <stage>` parameter for building particular Dockerfile stages
- script hooks/pre_build removes the `--target <stage>` parameter and always processes all Dockerfile stages
- see `readme-local-building-example.md` for more information

Other changes and improvements:

- `Dockerfiles.xfce` renamed to `Dockerfiles.xfce.20-04` and improved
- `Dockerfiles.xfce.22-04` added
- script `hooks/env.rc` updated
  - `noVNC` is always included in all images
  - Firefox **plus** features always included in Firefox images
- scripts `builder.sh` and `ci-builder.sh` have been updated
- most readme files have been updated

### Release 22.12.1

- Updated components:

  - **websockify** to version **0.11.0**

### Release 22.12

This is a maintenance release.

- README files have been updated
- Folder `examples/` has been moved up to the project's root folder
  - New example `Dockerfile.extended` shows how to use the images as the base of new images
  - New compose file `example.yml` shows how to switch to another non-root user and how to set the VNC password and resolution

### Release 22.11.1

This is a quick fix release, because `Chromium Browser` has changed its package naming pattern.

### Release 22.11 (Milestone)

This is a milestone release. It's the first release of the new building pipeline version `G3v2`. The previous version `G3v1` will still be available in this repository as the branch `archived-generation-g3v1`.

The version `G3v2` brings the following major changes:

- Significantly improved building performance by introducing a local cache (`g3-cache`).
- Auto-building on the **Docker Hub** and using of the **GitHub Actions** have been abandoned.
- The enhanced building pipeline moves towards building the images outside the **Docker Hub** and aims to support also stages with CI/CD capabilities (e.g. **GitLab**).
- The **local stage** is the default building stage. The new building pipeline has already been tested also with a local **GitLab** installation in a Docker container on a Linux machine.
- Automatic publishing of README files to the **Docker Hub** has been removed, because it hasn't work properly any more. However, the README files can be still prepared with the provided utility and then copy-and-pasted to the **Docker Hub** manually.

Added files:

- `docker/hooks/cache`
- `ci-builder.sh`
- `readme-builder.md`
- `readme-ci-builder.md`
- `readme-g3-cache.md`
- `readme-local-building-example.md`
- `utils/readme-util-readme-examples.md`

Removed files:

- `local-builder-readme.md`
- `local-building-example.md`
- `utils/example-secrets-utils.rc`
- `utils/examples-util-readme.md`
- `.github/workflows/dockerhub-autobuild.yml`
- `.github/workflows/dockerhub-post-push.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-readme.sh`

Many other files have been updated, some of them significantly.

Hoverer, the changes affect only the building pipeline, not the Docker images themselves. The `Dockerfile`, apart from using the new local `g3-cache`, stays conceptually unchanged.

### Release 22.10 (Milestone)

This is the last release of the current building pipeline generation `G3v1`, which will still be available in the repository as the branch `archived-generation-g3v1`.

The next milestone release will bring some significant changes and improvements in the building pipeline (generation `G3v2`) . The changing parts marked as `DEPRECATED` will be replaced or removed.

### Release 22.09

This is just a maintenance release.

- Warnings about the *README publishing not always working* problem have been added.
- Some comments have been updated.

### Release 22.04

- **noVNC** improvements

  - **noVNC** got a new optional argument, which is passed through a new environment variable **NOVNC_HEARTBEAT**
  
    - set the variable by creating the container, like `docker run -e NOVNC_HEARTBEAT=30` for the ping interval 30 seconds
    - it should prevent disconnections because of inactivity, if the container is used behind load-balancers or reverse proxies ([issue #23](https://github.com/accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3/issues/23))

  - script `vnc_startup.rc` has been adjusted and improved
  - script `version_of.sh` has been adjusted
  - **numpy** module has been added to make the HyBi protocol faster

  - following variables related to **noVNC** has been renamed in all related files
    - `ARG_NO_VNC_PORT` renamed to `ARG_NOVNC_PORT`
    - `NO_VNC_HOME` renamed to `NOVNC_HOME`
    - `NO_VNC_PORT` renamed to `NOVNC_PORT`

### Release 22.02

- Updated components:

  - **TigerVNC** to version **1.12.0**
  - **noVNC** to version **1.3.0**
  - **websockify** to version **0.10.0**

- Added components:

  - **python3** (also added into the `verbose version sticker`)
  - **systemctl**

  - `vnc_startup.rc` (new **noVNC** startup)
  - `version_of.sh` (**python3** included)
  - `version_sticker.sh` (**python3** included)
  - `env.rc` (handling of tags)
  - `util-readme.sh` (fixed token parsing)
  - all readme files

- Added files:

  - `local-builder-readme.md`

- Changes in building and publishing policy:

  - The images without **noVNC** will not be published on Docker Hub any more, because the size difference is now only 2MB. However, they always can be built locally.
  - The images tagged `latest` will always implement **VNC** and **noVNC**.
  - The Firefox image `latest` will not include the *Firefox plus features* now. They will be available in the Firefox image `latest-plus`.
